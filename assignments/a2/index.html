    <h2>Issues Found</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>15 Contrast errors</li>
        <li>5 Linked images missing alternative text</li>
        <li>10 Empty links</li>
        <li>1 Missing form label</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <p>The navigation seems to be crowded and easy to miss, I would maybe simplify the navigation and make it more accessible.</p>
      <p>I would also make the icons more consistant with each other.</p>
      <p>I would like to see the webpage be catered more towards helping a dyslex person navigate throught the website. It does not seem user friendly to someone who has dyslexia.</P>
      <p>The website also feels very crowded in its layout, I would simplify the layout to make it more attractive to the viewer.</p>
